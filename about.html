    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>We LOVE video games. We eat, drink, sleep, and breath them every single day. But weâ€™re especially
      drawn to the Indie game, specifically developed by the small independent studio who produces games which are
      unique, original, fan-based, widely-varied, but (un)fortunately underrated.</p>

    <p>Along with the great benefits of these games, smaller shops also experience many struggles. Some
      are listed below with:</p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
      <li>Funding</li>
      <li>Resources</li>
      <li>Publicity</li>
    </ul>

    <p> We realized there was a need here, to help the local and independent game developer become more
      successful in what they do. So we created the platform, Skyplay, to help resolve some of the challenges of the
      Indie developer. Through this company, we can expose a larger audience, who desires to play action, adventure,
      role-playing, simulation, strategy, and sports Indie games.</p>

    <p>How we specifically do this: we pay a monthly fee to developers for access to each Indie game
      which we, in turn, upload to our servers. Making these games available to gamers on a wider basis, increases the
      profit potential for the developer, affording the smaller shop more resources to create even better games in the
      future.</p>

    <p>We see our service as a support to the work of the ultimate geniuses of independent game
      development--- the designers, artists, sound engineers, programmers, and testers.</p>

    <p>Skyplay is a platform created by gamers, in support of the Indie game developer and player.</p>
    <p>We are Skyplay.</p>
